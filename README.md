# Rewrite Dawn Theme

## Purpose
- Clean, modernised Dawn codebase that strips legacy bloat.
- Full control of SEO tactics and JSON-LD output without third-party apps.
- Minimal external app dependencies to simplify maintenance and improve performance.
- Forward-compatible foundation for future headless builds powered by Eleventy + Strapi.

## Key Features
- **Structured data**: bespoke JSON-LD snippets (articles, breadcrumbs, cart, products) tuned for our content strategy and easily extendable.
- **Custom sections & snippets**: modular Liquid components supporting rapid layout experiments while keeping rendering logic tidy.
- **Pipeline linkage**: theme consumes assets and content generated by the Eleventy/Strapi build pipeline, ensuring parity between static and Shopify storefront experiences.

## Installation & Usage
- **Clone**: `git clone git@github.com:<org>/rewrite-dawn-theme.git && cd rewrite-dawn-theme`
- **Connect to Shopify**: link the repo to your Shopify store via GitHub in the Shopify admin, selecting the `main` branch for the live theme.
- **Local development**:
  - Install Shopify CLI (`npm install -g @shopify/cli @shopify/theme` or use Homebrew).
  - Run `shopify login --store <store-domain>` to authenticate.
  - Start the dev server with `shopify theme dev --store <store-domain>`, then edit Liquid/JSON/assets locally.
- **Publish**: push changes, then in Shopify admin promote the latest `main` build (or run `shopify theme push` with the `--publish` flag when ready).

## Branching Strategy
- `main`: production-ready theme; only merge tested, reviewed work.
- Feature branches: create `feature/<short-description>` for each change, keep rebased on `main`, and delete after merge.

## Contribution Guidelines
- **Flow**: branch → develop → ensure Shopify preview works → open PR to `main`.
- **Testing**: run available unit checks (`npm test` if present) and verify `shopify theme check` passes before opening a PR.
- **Formatting**: follow existing Liquid/JSON style, run Prettier (if configured) and keep commits scoped, descriptive, and squashed where appropriate.
